            <h2>Definition: What Is Web3 (or Web 3.0)?</h2>
            <p>Web3 is the third generation of the internet currently being built, where websites and apps will be able to process information in a smart human-like way through technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), Big Data, decentralized ledger technology (DLT), and more.</p>
            <p>At present, Web3 is still a rather undefined concept that could take 5-10 years to build if we look at the transition from Web2 to Web3. In fact, we might very well first see a prolonged era of Web2.5, where Web2 platforms gradually onboard useful Web3 protocols.</p>
            <p>There is broad consensus amongst experts that blockchain-powered applications will be key to its success in order to ensure adequate decentralization, while AI and ML tools will help automate and scale it as required in order to become a semantic web.</p>
            <p>Web3 was in fact originally called the Semantic Web by World Wide Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee, and was aimed at being a more autonomous, intelligent, and open internet.The Web3 definition can be expanded as follows: data will be interconnected in a decentralized way, which would be a huge leap forward for our current generation of the internet (Web 2.0), where data is mostly stored in centralized repositories and therefore subject to manipulation or worse.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, users and machines will be able to interact with data. But for this to happen, programs need to understand information both conceptually and contextually. With this in mind, the two cornerstones of Web3 are semantic web and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies.</p>
            <h2>What Is Web3 Used For?</h2>
            <p>While Web3 technology is still very nascent, it already offers a number of distinct use cases. Here are the top 5 at present:</p>
            <p><b>Metaverse</b>The concept of the metaverse dominated tech headlines in 2022, with Facebook even rebranding to Meta and dropping billions into development in order to annex this new digital realm before anyone else could. Well, not so fast there Zuck. As Meta’s Q3 2022 earnings and tanking stock price have shown, investors and users are not very enthused about Facebook’s metaverse plans.</p>
            <p>All this will cost a tremendous amount of money to build, which is why deep-pocketed big tech brands like Facebook and Google have invested heavily in it early in order to dominate the sector later. Web3 proposes a very different metaverse vision, one that is fully open to anyone, decentralized, interoperable, open-source and will reward creators and security contributors fairly.
              Again, this is where Web2.5 will likely come in, with both industries taking ideas from the other and working together in order to make the metaverse a reality.</p>
            <p><b>Blockchain Gaming</b>The success of Axie Infinity in 2021 kicked off the play-to-earn mania, promising gamers the opportunity to make money from playing games. Soon, thousands of copycat blockchain-powered games popped up offering lucrative rewards to players in the form of native tokens which skyrocketed at launch and then continued to tank.
              While the bear market devastated the high-risk sector of crypto gaming, it’s not game over just yet. A number of high-quality crypto games are still in development, while Web2 gaming behemoths like Epic Games are distributing Web3 games. Expect a strong resurgence in blockchain gaming, when developers figure out how to make it fun and exciting enough for players.</p>
              <p><b>Creator Economy</b>One of the biggest gripes with Web 2.0 giants such as Facebook, YouTube and Spotify are that they don’t adequately reward artists and creators on their platforms for the visitors they pull in.

                With Web3, creator communities of artists, writers, musicians, designers and developers will finally be able to bypass intermediaries and connect directly with their audiences and supporters. This will help them earn the bulk of any revenue generated in the process.</p>
                <p><b>Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)</b>Much has been said about the power of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) to create a truly democratized and self-governing organization that will transcend human interference and geographical challenges through the power of smart contracts.
                  While DAOs have taken some flak due to crypto projects tying it to governance tokens that soon become worthless, the need for DAOs still remain and this innovation could potentially exist as a dominant organizational structure once projects know how to optimally structure it.</p>
                  <p><b>Decentralized Finance (DeFi)</b>Decentralized finance (DeFi) exploded in value in mid-2020, offering cryptocurrency users the ability to invest, borrow, lend, trade and stake crypto assets permissionlessly. While DeFi faced its fair share of security issues like hacks and scams, the industry offers Web3 the opportunity to onboard potentially billions of users that have been neglected by traditional finance firms such as banks.
                    DeFi products and services will undoubtedly be used in leading Web3 protocols looking to incentivize their users.</p>
