            <h2>Full-Stack Developer</h2>
            <p>Do you have an interest in web programming? Do you identify with the phrase “jack of all trades”? If you answered yes, then becoming a full-stack developer might be a good career choice for you!</p>
            <p>A full-stack developer is someone who works on both the front-end and back-end of websites and web applications. In plainer terms, this type of developer is concerned with what web app users see and interact with and the functionality they don’t see, like communication among web browsers, servers, and databases. (We’ll explain these differences in more detail later.)</p>
            <p>To enter a new profession, you generally need to start by doing some research and self-analysis. Full-stack development is no exception. To help you understand this step and all the others in the journey ahead, we’ve made a roadmap. As you read it, you will:

              <br>- Find answers to big questions about becoming a full-stack developer
              <br>- Learn a structured approach to preparing to join the ranks of full-stack devs
              <br>- Encounter resources for learning more about this occupation
          </p>
          <p>A smaller map: We’ve been down the full-stack road before with a JavaScript-focused guide. But today, we’ll provide a more complete career roadmap with step-by-step instructions and a more comprehensive list of skills to learn.</p>
          <p>Your journey will be unique, and not everything in this article will resonate with you. You’ll also find that some of our answers are a bit vague due to the variability of individual career paths. But by the time you finish reading, we think you’ll have a clearer sense of the road you’ll be traveling.</p>
          <h2>Steps to becoming a full-stack developer</h2>
          <p>Before we begin, we need to acknowledge something. Your journey into this field will not look like, say, your developer friend’s journey, just as theirs didn’t match those of their predecessors. What you already know how to do and how you learned those skills will influence the steps you take. But shared standards exist despite this variation, and many developers and software engineers have taken certain actions to reach their goals. Let’s take a look at those actions now.</p>
          <h2>Step 0: Understand full-stack development</h2>
          <p>We offered a quick definition of full-stack development earlier, but it’s worth another look. If you’re committing to this occupation, then understanding the distinction between front-end development and back-end development is important because you will do both.</p>
          <p>The functionality of websites and web apps depends on working code on both ends. Front-end developers work on user interfaces (UI) and what web apps do on the client side. That means everything that users see and interact with on end-user devices. Back-end developers concern themselves with what web apps do on the server side. That typically involves the dynamic display of information that is transmitted from a database on a server to that end-user device. Becoming either a front-end developer or back-end developer requires plenty of education and training. In some ways, becoming a full-stack developer requires even more.</p>
          <p>Some basic technologies and skills form the foundation that all three kinds of developers build upon. But front-end and back-end roles require some specialization, too. You’ll find an overview of these combined skills and other requirements for becoming a full-stack developer as you continue reading.</p>
          <h2>Step 1: Make a plan</h2>
          <p>You should kick off your journey with research and planning. For starters, consider the fundamental decision of how you want to get the required education and training. Learning the skills to become a full-stack developer will require a lot of time and energy, so you’ll want to carefully consider your options. Many aspiring developers pursue a degree in computer science or a related field, which may be what some employers prefer. But you can certainly launch a coding career without such a degree. Other options are to attend a bootcamp, earn a university certificate, or study on your own.</p>
        
        <h2>Step 2: Get an education</h2>
        <p>We’re now going to compare your various educational options and their pros and cons. As we said earlier, you can choose between a degree program or other options, but you’ll be hard-pressed to start a full-stack developer career without some kind of education.</p>
        <h2>Step 3: Get real-world experience</h2>
        <p>Employers are often reluctant to hire developers who haven’t proven themselves in previous roles. But if you’re just starting out, your work history may not contain much relevant experience. Where can you find the practical opportunities you need?</p>
        <p>You should definitely preserve your efforts on these real-world endeavors in a portfolio, which you can later showcase to potential employers.

          Time estimate: This step may require several months, but you can take on as many of these pursuits as possible while you get your education.</p>
        <h2>Step 4: Earn a certification (optional)</h2>
        <p>You can bolster your credentials by earning a software development certification. You may not be able to do this during or immediately after your education, because some providers require previous software development experience from candidates. But certifications are worth considering down the road as a way to advance your career.</p>
        <h2>Step 5: Prepare for your job search</h2>
        <p>
          Polish your portfolio: With a free GitHub account, you can maintain the code from your individual and open-source projects in repositories that recruiters and potential employers can view. (As an added advantage, you’ll get hands-on experience with version control, an important skill for any developer.)
      </p>
      <p> Do mock interviews: Take some time to study common coding problems, technical questions, and behavioral questions and practice how you might answer them.</p>
      <p>Network: Connecting to established developers and companies you might apply to can help you learn about the interview process, company quirks, and other tips. Resources like alumni groups, LinkedIn, and other social networks will make connecting easier.</p>
      <h2>Step 6: Search for full-stack developer jobs</h2>
      <p>When you feel prepared, take a deep breath, and start your job search. You can research and apply for open positions using websites like ZipRecruiter, Dice, Glassdoor, Indeed, etc. Job application software or a spreadsheet can help you track all your applications and their different statuses.</p>
