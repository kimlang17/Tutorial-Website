            <h2>7 Ways to Increase Productivity While Studying</h2>
            <p>Have you ever come across a situation where you are sitting in your study chair and re-reading the same paragraph repeatedly, and nothing is going inside your head? Moreover, you are constantly struggling hard to memorize your lesson and still are unable to complete your task? If all these dialogue boxes are making giant checks in your mind, then you are not alone. The majority of the students are in this dilemma, and they grapple with bringing productive hours to their studies.

Be it motivational and inspirational posters of foremost personalities or the use of sticky notes, flashcards, highlighters, etc, these materials will assist to keep you engaged with your books. You can also creatively clean your desk with all the essential materials as per your need. </p>
            <h2>3. Start with your favourite subject</h2>
            <p>Students will admit that they have their favourite subjects on their list. Some love to do mathematical calculations, and some love to do grammar. You can start studying by focusing more on your favourite subject. It will aid in keeping you motivated, and you will feel that you were productive throughout. It will keep you adhered to your study desks for a long time, and you will be confident after summarising your lesson. </p>
            <h2>4. Make a 21-day-plan</h2>
            <p>Making a schedule is a vital part of bringing productivity to your study plan. It helps in keeping you focused on your main goal and lessens distractions. It will keep you inspired to complete your daily task and finish your assignments on time. In addition to this, it will keep you consistent. </p>
            <h2>5. Be inquisitive</h2>
            <p>Asking and bringing discussions to your table will serve you best. It will not only make you active but will also open numerous portals of new knowledge. It will develop a habit of critical thinking and will boost your communication skills. If you will practice asking questions, it might dwindle the chances of unproductive minutes from your studying routine. </p>
            <h2>6. Reward yourself</h2>
            <p>Affirm to the thought that you will finish a topic in 45 minutes and after completion of the task, you will reward yourself. Allow yourself to use social media, go for a walk, relax and stretch your muscles, sate your appetite with some savories, etc. Never get drained by a hectic day. Prioritize your mental health too. </p>
            <h2>7. Take help from Professionals</h2>
            <p>If you are dedicated to your subject and want appropriate results, then seeking help from a professional tutor is the best solution to implement.
